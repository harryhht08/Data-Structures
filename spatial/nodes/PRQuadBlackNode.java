     *

     *     all the available{@link KDPoint}s. This process will continue until we reach a {@link PRQuadGrayNode}
     *     which successfully separates all the {@link KDPoint}s of the quadrant it represents. Programmatically speaking,
     *     this means that the method will polymorphically call itself, splitting black nodes into gray nodes as long as
     *     is required for there to be a set of 4 quadrants that separate the points between them. This is one of the major
     *     bottlenecks in PR-QuadTrees; the presence of a pair of {@link KDPoint}s with a very small {@link
     *     KDPoint#distanceSquared(KDPoint) distanceSquared} between them can negatively impact search in certain subplanes, because
